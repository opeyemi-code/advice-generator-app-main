## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

During the course of this project, i learned about the `offsetHeight` and `offsetWidth` properties. These two properties are used to get the visible height and width of an element which icludes vertical padding and border for height and horizontal padding and border for width.

### Continued development

I look forward to learning more about APIs and working with them to build complex application.
